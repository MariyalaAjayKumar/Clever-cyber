                <p class="matter">A continuous stream of information on actual or possible security threats to an
                    organisation is known as a threat intelligence feed, or TI feed. Information on
                    assaults, including as zero-day attacks, malware, botnets, and other security risks,
                    is provided through TI feeds. In order to detect and stop security breaches, TI
                    feeds are essential parts of the security infrastructure. danger intelligence can help
                    detect probable traits or behaviours connected to that danger as well as be utilised
                    to set more granular security measures.</p>
                <p>Threat intelligence is gathered to help organizations understand emerging threats
                    in the cybersecurity landscape, including zero-day threats, advanced persistent
                    threats and exploits. Threat actors may also include internal and partner threats,
                    but the emphasis is on outside sources that might cause the most damage to a
                    particular organization's environment.</p>
