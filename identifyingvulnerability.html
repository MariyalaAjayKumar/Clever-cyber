                <p>As an individual, finding vulnerabilities in a website you are accessing 
                    should be approached responsibly and legally. Unauthorized scanning or testing of websites without the owner's permission is illegal 
                    and can lead to severe consequences. However, you can follow these:</p>

                <h2 class="heading"> Ethical steps to identify potential vulnerabilities</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>1.Check for Security Certificates: </span>: Ensure the website uses HTTPS and has a valid SSL/TLS certificate. This ensures data encryption during transmission.</li>
                    <li><span>2.Inspect URLs: </span>Verify the URL for any suspicious characters or misspellings that may indicate a phishing attempt.</li>
                    <li><span>3.View Page Source: </span>Examine the page source for any sensitive information exposed or any poorly implemented code.</li>
                    <li><span>4.Web Application Firewall (WAF) Testing: </span>Check if the website is protected by a WAF that can block common attacks like SQL injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).</li>
                    <li><span>5.Report Suspicious Behaviour: </span>If you encounter any suspicious behaviour on the website, such as error messages revealing sensitive information, contact the website owner or administrator to report the issue.</li>
                    <li><span>6.Ethical Hacking: </span>If you have proper authorization and skills, you may perform ethical hacking or penetration testing on websites to identify vulnerabilities. However, this should only be done with the owner's consent and involvement of professionals.</li>
                    <li><span>7.Bug Bounty Programs: </span>Some websites have bug bounty programs where they offer rewards to individuals who responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="heading">To check if the application you are using is safe or compromised, follow these steps:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>1.*Official App Stores*: </span>Download apps only from official app stores like Google Play Store (for Android) or Apple App Store (for iOS). These platforms have security measures in place to minimize the risk of compromised apps.</li>
                    <li><span>2.*Check App Permissions*: </span>Review the app's permissions before installing it. Be cautious if the app is asking for excessive or unnecessary permissions, as it might be a sign of potential security risks.</li>
                    <li><span>3.*App Reviews and Ratings*: </span>Check user reviews and ratings in the app store. Low ratings or negative feedback may indicate issues or compromised functionality.</li>
                    <li><span>4.*Developer Information*: </span>Research the app developer's reputation and verify their official website or contact details.</li>
                    <li><span>5.*Mobile Security Apps*: </span>Install reputable mobile security apps that can detect and warn you about potentially harmful or compromised applications.</li>
                    <li><span>6.*Application Updates*: </span>Keep your apps up to date with the latest versions. Updates often include bug fixes and security patches to address vulnerabilities.</li>
                    <li><span>7. *Security Scanning Tools*: </span>Use mobile security scanning tools or antivirus apps to check for any potential security threats on your device.</li>
                    <li><span>8. *App Behaviour Analysis*: </span>Pay attention to unusual behaviour from apps, such as excessive data usage, unexpected battery drain, or frequent crashes.</li>
                    <li><span>9. *App Sandbox Environment*: </span>If possible, test the app in a sandboxed or isolated environment to analyse its behaviour without affecting your main system.</li>
                    <li><span>10.*App Permissions Audit*: </span>Regularly review and manage app permissions to ensure only necessary access is granted.</li>
                    <li><span>11.*Security Research Reports*: </span>Stay informed about security research reports and news that highlight any compromised or vulnerable apps.</li>
