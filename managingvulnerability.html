                <h2 class="heading">VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT</h2>
                <p>The process of identifying, classifying, resolving, and mitigating security vulnerabilities is known as 
                    vulnerability management. Vulnerability management consists of three key components: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1.Vulnerability detection</li>
                    <li>2.Vulnerability assessment</li>
                    <li>3.Addressing Vulnerabilities</li>
                </ul>

            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class="heading">Vulnerability Detection</h2>
                <h4>Cyber Security Vulnerability Scan</h4>
                <p>The Cyber Security Vulnerability Scan is performed to discover computer, program, or network vulnerabilities. A scanner 
                    (software) is used to find and pinpoint network vulnerabilities resulting from improper configuration and poor programming.</p>
                <p>SolarWinds Network Configuration Manager (NCM), 
                    ManageEngine Vulnerability Manager Plus, Rapid7 Nexpose, TripWire IP 360, and others are some common vulnerability detection solutions.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class="heading">Vulnerability Assessment</h2>
                <p>The next step after finding vulnerabilities is to conduct a cybersecurity vulnerability 
                    assessment to ascertain the threat they represent to your organisation. Utilising vulnerability assessments,
                     you can rank remediation tasks according to the risk levels of threats that were found. By ensuring that vulnerabilities are corrected before they may be used against the 
                    organisation, effective evaluations enhance compliance efforts.</p>
    
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class="heading">Addressing Vulnerabilities</h2>
                <p>Once the risk level of a vulnerability has been established, the vulnerability must next be addressed. There are various approaches you can take when dealing with a vulnerability. These consist of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>•	Remediation:</span>A vulnerability is remedied by being totally addressed or patched as part of vulnerability correction. This is one of the most popular approaches to treating vulnerabilities since it lowers risk.</li>
                    <li><span>•	Mitigation</span>Making a vulnerability less likely to be exploited is necessary in order to mitigate it. Vulnerability mitigation is typically carried out to buy time prior to the release of an appropriate patch.</li>
                    <li><span>•	Acceptance</span>It is allowed to take no action to address a vulnerability when an organisation determines that it poses a low risk. Acceptance is also permitted when patching the vulnerability will cost more than patching it in the event that it is exploited. Acceptance refers to a circumstance or a process like this.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class="heading">COMBATING VULNERABILITIES</h2>
                <p>To effectively combat vulnerabilities in cyber security, consider these strategies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>1. Regular Security Audits: </span>Conduct frequent audits to identify and fix potential weaknesses in your systems and infrastructure.</li>
                    <li><span>2. Patch Management: </span>Keep all software, operating systems, and applications up to date with the latest security patches to minimize vulnerabilities.</li>
                    <li><span>3. Employee Training: </span>Educate your staff about cyber threats, phishing, and social engineering to prevent them from falling victim to attacks.</li>
                    <li><span>4. Strong Password Policies: </span>Enforce strong password practices, such as using complex passwords, multi-factor authentication, and regular password changes.</li>
                    <li><span>5. Network Segmentation: </span>Segment your network to limit the spread of an attack if one part is compromised.</li>
                    <li><span>6. Regular Backups: </span>Regularly backup critical data to minimize the impact of potential ransomware attacks.</li>
                    <li><span>7. Intrusion Detection and Prevention: </span>Use tools like intrusion detection and prevention systems to detect and stop unauthorized access attempts.</li>
                    <li><span>8. Encryption: </span>Encrypt sensitive data, both in transit and at rest, to protect it from unauthorized access.</li>
                    <li><span>9. Limit User Privileges: </span>Grant users the minimum level of access needed to perform their duties to reduce the potential damage of a compromised account.</li>
                    <li><span>10. Incident Response Plan: </span>Develop a comprehensive incident response plan to handle and mitigate security breaches effectively.</li>
                    <li><span>11. Secure Development Practices: </span>Follow secure coding practices during software development to minimize the introduction of vulnerabilities.</li>
                    <li><span>12. Penetration Testing: </span>Conduct regular penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify weak points in your systems.</li>
