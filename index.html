            <p>More specifically, The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines a
             vulnerability in security as the weakness of an asset or group of assets that can be exploited
              by one or more cyber threats where an asset is anything that has value to the organization, its 
              business operations, and their continuity, including information resources that support the organization's mission. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="heading">What is Cyber Security Vulnerabilities?</h2>

            <p>A cyber security vulnerability is any weakness in an organization's internal controls, system processes, or information systems. Hackers and cybercriminals may target these weaknesses and exploit them through the weak spots. 
            Without authorization, these hackers have the ability to access networks and seriously compromise data privacy. In the current world, data is a gold mine that needs to be carefully secured. Because network weaknesses could result in a total compromise of an organization's systems, it is imperative to regularly check for cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

                    Examples of Cyber Security Vulnerabilities
                </p>
                <h2 class="heading" >Here are a few examples of cybersecurity vulnerabilities</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>• Missing data encryption</li>
                    <li>• Lack of security cameras</li>
                    <li>• Unlocked doors at businesses</li>
                    <li>• Unrestricted upload of dangerous files</li>
                    <li>• Code downloads without integrity checks</li>
                    <li>• Using broken algorithms</li>
                    <li>• URL Redirection to untrustworthy websites</li>
                    <li>• Weak and unchanged passwords </li>
                    <li>• Website without SSL</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="heading">Vulnerabilities, Exploits, and Threats at a Glance:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>• In cybersecurity, there are important differences between vulnerabilities, exploits, and threats.</li>
                    <li>• While a vulnerability refers to weaknesses in hardware, software, or procedures—the entryway for hackers to access systems—an exploit is the actual malicious code that cybercriminals use to take advantage of vulnerabilities and compromise the IT infrastructure.</li>
                    <li>• A threat is a potentially dangerous event that has not occurred but has the potential to cause damage if it does. Exploits are how threats become attacks, and vulnerabilities are how exploits gain access to targeted systems.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class="heading">Cyber Security Vulnerability Becoming Exploitable</h2>
                <p>A vulnerability that can be exploited has at least one distinct attack vector. Attackers look for weak spots in the system or network for obvious reasons. Of course, no one wants to be weak, but the possibility of someone taking advantage of it should worry you more. In some cases, a vulnerability cannot be exploited. Possible causes include:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>1.Insufficient public awareness for attackers to take advantage of.</li>
                <li>2.The attacker might not have had prior authorization or access to the local system.</li>
                <li>3.Current safety precautions.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>

                <h2 class="heading">Causes of Cyber Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
                <p>There are many causes of cyber security vulnerabilities. A few of them are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Complexity:</span> The likelihood of errors, defects, or unauthorized access
                        increases with complex systems.</li>
                    <li><span>Familiarity:</span> Attackers may already be acquainted with common code, operating systems, hardware, and software that result in well-known vulnerabilities. </li>
                    <li><span>Connectivity:</span> Vulnerabilities are more likely to exist in connected devices. It is better to avoid connecting to multiple devices unnecessarily.</li>
                    <li><span>Poor Password Management:</span> This can cause several data breaches because of weak or repeated passwords. It is important to change passwords using strong password generators regularly.</li>
                    <li><span>Internet:</span> Spyware and adware that can be loaded on computers automatically are abundant on the internet.</li>
                    <li><span>Operating System Flaws: </span> Operating systems can also be flawed. Operating systems that aren’t safe by default might provide users unrestricted access and serve as a haven for malware and viruses.</li>
                    <li><span>Software Bugs: </span> Sometimes, programmers may unintentionally introduce a vulnerability that can exploit.</li>
                    <li><span>Unchecked User Input: </span> If software or a website presumes that all user input is secure, SQL injection may be executed without the user’s knowledge.</li>
                    <li><span>People:</span> For most organizations, social engineering poses the biggest concern. Therefore, one of the main sources of vulnerability can be people.</li>
